        <h1>EDUCATION</h1>
        <p>I have always been passionate about technology, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systemsâ€”a perfect blend of management and technology. 
            During my studies, I discovered my strong interest in coding, particularly the visual aspects of it. 
            This realization, along with a recommendation from a friend who shared his bootcamp experience, inspired me to enroll in one myself. 
            I see this as just as the stepping stone of my journey, as I am eager to enrich my knowledge in front-end development and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow into a better developer.
